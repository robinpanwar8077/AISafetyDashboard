# AI Safety Incident Dashboard

This project is a web-based dashboard for tracking and managing potential AI safety incidents. It is built using React, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Lucide for icons.

**Live Demo:** [https://aisafetydashboard.netlify.app/](https://aisafetydashboard.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository from Git:**

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_CLONE_URL>
    cd ai-safety-dashboard
    ```

    _(Replace `<YOUR_GIT_CLONE_URL>` with the actual URL of your Git repository)_

2.  **Install the necessary dependencies:**

    This project uses Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, run the following command in the project directory:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will download and install all the libraries and dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide.

3.  **Run the development server:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will typically start a local development server (usually at `http://localhost:5173/` or a similar address). Open this URL in your web browser to view the dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Lucide:** A library of beautiful and consistent open-source icons.
- **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and enjoyable development experience. (This is the underlying build tool used by the `npm run dev` script).
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** The package manager used to install and manage project dependencies.
